ðŸ“Œ Project Title: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project aims to classify human activities (walking, sitting, standing, etc.) using sensor data (accelerometer & gyroscope) from the UCI HAR dataset. We implemented both Machine Learning (SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) and Deep Learning (LSTM, CNN) models to compare their effectiveness in human activity recognition.

ðŸ“Œ Dataset: UCI HAR Dataset
Collected using: Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone
Data Type: Accelerometer & Gyroscope signals
Activities Monitored:
âœ… Walking
âœ… Walking Upstairs
âœ… Walking Downstairs
âœ… Sitting
âœ… Standing
âœ… Lying Down
ðŸ“Œ Dataset Structure
X_train.txt & X_test.txt â†’ Sensor features (561 features per sample)
y_train.txt & y_test.txt â†’ Activity labels
features.txt â†’ Names of 561 extracted features
subject_train.txt & subject_test.txt â†’ Subject IDs for tracking participants

ðŸ“Œ Results & Model Comparison
Model	Accuracy
âœ… SVM (Best ML Model)	95.12%
Random Forest	92.5%
Logistic Regression	95%
LSTM (Best DL Model)83%
âœ… CNN	99.52%
ðŸ”¹ 1D CNN performed the best, followed by LSTM.
ðŸ”¹ SVM outperformed all traditional ML models.
